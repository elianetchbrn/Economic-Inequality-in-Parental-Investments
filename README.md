## Abstract

This repository contains the research materials accompanying the master thesis  
*Economic Inequality in Parental Investments: A Dual Perspective on Time and Financial Resources.*

Using data from the German Time Use Survey (2022) and the German Expenditure Survey (2018), this thesis explores how parental time and financial investments in Germany vary across the child’s life course and between four groups: lower parental education, risk of poverty, single par, and migration background. The analysis focuses on developmentally enriching forms of investment that foster child development. Results show that parental time and money shift from basic care and consumption toward education-focused investments as children grow older. Substantial social disparities emerge: children from less-educated and low-income families receive significantly less developmentally enriching time and money, particularly in reading, educational childcare, and tutoring. These gaps appear to reflect suboptimal prioritization rather than purely resource scarcity. By contrast, single parents tend to allocate their limited resources strategically, emphasizing high-value activities such as reading and educational support. Differences among families with a migration background are comparatively small.

## Research Objectives

The study addresses the following research questions:

1. How do parental time investments vary across the child’s age?
2. How do financial expenditures on children evolve over the life course?
3. To what extent do parental investments differ across socioeconomic groups, including:
   - Parental education
   - Poverty risk
   - Single parenthood
   - Migration background
4. Are observed differences primarily driven by resource constraints or by prioritization patterns?

## Methodological Approach

The empirical strategy includes:

- Construction of harmonized time-use aggregates
- Categorization of child-related expenditures
- Socioeconomic stratification of households
- Descriptive and distributional comparisons across groups
- Life-course analysis by child age

The analysis distinguishes between total investments and developmentally enriching investments and discusses structural versus behavioral explanations of inequality.
